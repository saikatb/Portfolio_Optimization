# Portfolio_Optimization

In this project we made a portfolio consisting of several technical stocks andd wanted to minimize negative sharpe ratio. 
By minimizing the negative sharpe ratio we checked all the optimal portfolios which can be found from the efficient frontier curve.
Efficient frontier is the set of all the optimal portfolios that offers highest ecxpected return for a defined level of risk or the lowest risk possible for a given level of Expected Return.
